# KanKei: Kanji Lookup Tool

## Overview
**KanKei** (漢係) web-based application designed to assist Japanese learners in understanding the etymological relationships between kanji by breaking them down into components. The purpose of component-based kanji learning is to help learners create mental connections between kanji to make them intuitive to learn without rote memorization. Similar websites already exist, such as [HanziCraft](https://hanzicraft.com/) and [zi.tools](https://zi.tools/)), however those are more targetted towards Chinese learning. This site is more focused towards Japanese Kanji, although it still displays data for Mandarin or Cantonese.

To search for a Kanji, you can enter any combination of kanji, components, pronunciations, or meanings. 

## Displayed Data
- Kanji character details (meanings, pronunciations, components)
- Etymological component breakdowns and character series per component
- Etymological explanation of glyph origin
- Inclusion of kanji in popular media (anime, manga, games, VNs) and general Japanese texts.
- Tags (e.g., 常用 [Jōyō], 人名用 [Jinmeiyō], liushu category)

## Features
- **Tabs for Multiple Searches:** Users can perform and retain several searches simultaneously within the same browser tab.
- **Search History and Bookmarks:** Keep track of past searches and bookmark entries for quick access.
- **Customizable Filters:** Control the visibility of data points such as tags, variant characters, and Mandarin or Cantonese data.
