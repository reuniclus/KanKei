KanKei is a Kanji/Hanzi lookup tool focused on the breaking down Kanji into components and displaying the etymological relationships between multiple kanji.

The purpose of component-based kanji learning is to help learners create mental connections between kanji to make them intuitive to learn without rote memorization.

Similar resources already exist, such as HanziCraft and zi.tools, however those are more targetted towards Chinese learning. This site is more focused towards Japanese Kanji, although it still displays data for Mandarin or Cantonese.

To search for a Kanji, you can enter any combination of kanji, components, pronunciations, or meanings. For example:

English search: house
Component search: 釆田羽
Kanji search: 門
Tag search: #常用
Combined search: #常用 各 ラク (joyo kanji that include 各 and are pronounced raku)
